# Api

Mock API done with [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), because as a front-end dev I don't have time for APIs (but I do for IPAs).

## Usage

JSON Server must be installed globally to use this project :

```
npm install -g json-server
```

## Available Scripts

Start the mock server :

```
npm start
```

And start sending queries to `https://localhost:3001`
