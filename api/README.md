# Api

Mock API done with [JSON Server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server), because we, front-end devs, don't have time for APIs.

## Usage

JSON Server must be installed globally to use this project :

```
npm install -g json-server
```

## Available Scripts

Start the mock server :

```
npm start
```

And start sending queries to `https://localhost:3001`
